A/F Ratio Tuning/Visualization Device Development Project Summary

##2Objective
　To facilitate setting and visualization of the air-fuel ratio of a motorcycle.
　By visualization, we would like to understand the health condition of motorcycles and evaluate the appropriateness for customization of intake and exhaust systems.

##Background
　Custom ECU chips, sensor spoofing, and other devices of questionable effectiveness have been sold in large numbers.
　However, users do not have the means to objectively evaluate the validity of these devices.

##Target.
　Motorcycle users with one or two Bosch narrowband O2 sensors
　BMW R1100S, R1150R, R1150RT, and R1150GS are targeted until STEP 1 described below.
　Because the basic specifications of the air-fuel ratio measurement and ECU are the same as those of the test machine (R1100S).

##GOAL
　Develop and market a device that can set and visualize closed-loop and open-loop A/F ratios using a smartphone.

##Device Requirements
The device must be mounted on the motorcycle itself.
　The device shall operate on motorcycle voltage.
　The device must be able to withstand surges and inrush currents.
All operations must be completed by a smartphone.
　All operations must be completed by a smartphone, including firmware upload.
Compact as possible.
　->▪ Motorcycles have limited space for installation.
All designs must be open source.
　The source must be available in English.
The device should provide users with a manual on how to use the device.
Cost-effectiveness must be superior to the functions of competing products.
The accuracy of the air-fuel ratio measurement should be as high as possible.

##Sales channels and marketing
　Amzon and Ebay are under consideration.
　Beta version to FaceBook community, publicity

##Development Steps
　
###STEP1 Develop a device that utilizes a stock narrow band O2 sensor
　　Operation via smartphone
　　Open-loop map switching function by coding plug (optional)

　###STEP2 Development of device using commercially available Bosch broadband 02 sensor
　　->In short, a smartphone version of LC-2

   ###STEP3 (undecided) Development of a device with sub-controller function
　　->In essence, upward compatible with PowerCommander3.
　　->Smartphone operation, visualization of air-fuel ratio, and log acquisition

##Schedule
　Undecided
